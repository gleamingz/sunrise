<h1> Nanotechnology in Alzheimer's </h1>

<h4> WHAT IS NANOTECH: </h4>
<p style="color:blue;">Nanotechnology refers to the development or application of particles with dimensions that fall into the nanometre range (10-9 or one billionth of a meter) the interaction between the nanoscience and biological systems is known as nanobiotechnology while the associated area known as nanomedicine deals with the application of nanostructured materials to diagnose treat and prevent diseases
Nanomedicine can be used in the field of medicine by diagnostics i.e. in vivo and invitro  , medical imaging , nano therapeutics cancer immune-therapy vaccines regenerative medicine  personalized medicine targeted drugs and gene & cell therapie </p>

<h4> WHAT IS ALZHEIMER'S: </h4>
<p style="color:blue;">Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.
Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases.

Symptoms of Alzheimer's include: 
Inability to communicate
No awareness of recent experiences or surroundings
Weight loss with little interest in eating
Seizures
General physical decline, including dental, skin, and foot problems
Difficulty swallowing
Groaning, moaning, or grunting
Increased sleeping
There's no cure for Alzheimer's, but there are treatments that may change disease progression, and drug and non-drug options that may help treat symptoms.

<h4>TREATMENT IN ALZHEIMER'S: </h4>

<p style="color:blue;"></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li style="color:blue;"> Nanoparticle-Mediated Medication Delivery:      This approach is a recent development aimed at improving central nervous system (CNS) penetration for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's.
</li>
<li style="color:blue;">Potential of Polymeric Nanoparticles (PNPs):     Among various nanocarriers, polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) show promise. They have the ability to open the tight junctions of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), enhancing drug delivery to the brain.
</li>
<li style="color:blue;" >Concealing Membrane Barrier:                     PNPs effectively hide the membrane barrier characteristics of drug molecules. This concealment can be crucial in facilitating drug delivery to the brain.

</li>
<li style="color:blue;"> Prolonged Drug Release:                         PNPs contribute to the prolonged release of drugs, ensuring a sustained therapeutic effect over time.
</li>
<li style="color:blue;"> Protection Against Enzymatic Hydrolysis:        Additionally, PNPs offer protection to drugs against enzymatic hydrolysis, which can enhance drug stability and efficacy in Alzheimer's disease treatment.
